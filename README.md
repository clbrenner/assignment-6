exploring R packages 

## Package title
dplyr

## Location
Dplyr can be found on CRAN here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html

Dplyr can be found on GitHub here: https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr

## Vignette(s)
Dplyr has many vignettes. Dplyr has a long vignette on its website on the front page of the website. The vignette is designed to introduce a user to the purpose of dplyr and the functions and data sets it contains. The vignette has worked examples of the functions. It also groups functions into categories, such as functions that work on single columns or functions that work on multiple columns. Dplyr also has cheat sheets and other quick tools to learn and troubleshoot Dplyr within that page. There are many other vignettes on the websitel under articles (described below). 

### On their github, the vignettes folder contains 9 vignettes. 
* The Base vignette explains the similarities and differences between dlpyr and base R.
* In doing so, it describes the main differences in coding approach between dplyr and base R.
* The colwise vignette explains how to use dplyr functions to perform the same action on multiple columns.
* The dplyr vignette is the introductory vignette designed for first-time users. It is the vignette that pops up first on their website.
* The grouping data vignette explains how grouping works in dplyr. First, it explains how the functions that can group data work. Then it explains how the remaining functions within dplyr change when they are performed on grouped data.
* The Using dplyr in packages vignette is designed for package authors who intend to use dplyr within their packages. It describes best practices for avoiding errors and notes.
* The programming in dplyr package teaches how tidy evaluation works within dplyr functions. This vignette teaches how data masking and tidy selection work. It is designed to teach users how to use tidy evaluation in their own functions or loops.
* The row wise operations vignette instructs on how to use functions to perform operations on rows or groups of rows. It also teaches about list-columns and duscisses modeling with dplyr functions.
* The two table verbs vignette describes how to use dplyr functions to work with multiple data sets.
* Lastly, the window functions vignette introduces a group of functions that work on vectors to aggregate them. 

## Application(s)
Dplyr has a helpful website: https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/index.html

The vignettes described above are contained within it. 

## Review
The main purpose of {dplyr} is to make data manipulation easier. It is part of the tidyverse suite of packages. Dplyr functions are verbs that state the outcome produced by the function. As a result, the function names are fairly intuitive to a new user without much R background, such as myself. The functions within dplyr allow for a variety of possible manipulations to data frames, such as rearranging the data frame or subsetting. These functions allow for efficient data manipulation that otherwise would take many lines of basic R code. I find the summarize() function, which condenses the dataframe into a single row, particularly useful. Overall, I would recommend dlpyr to a friend since it makes data manipulation efficient and intuitive.
